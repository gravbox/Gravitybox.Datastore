# Datastore

This is a faceted navigation engine. It allows for the creation of a data schema based on a C# object. Data based on the defined schema can be added to a data repository and then queried. This is similar to a traditional database except that the schema is small (single object) and searching is performed on the faceted values defined in the schema.
